  **Route Services** transform or process requests before they reach an app

    <i class="fa fa-sitemap" style="font-size: 120px; margin-top: 30px;"></i>

  * Bound to routes, not apps
  * Can be re-used between apps
  * Use cases:
    * Authentication
    * Rate limiting
    * Caching
  * Not for internal domains

notes: |

  Advanced feature. GoRouter sends requests to a URL _before_ sending it to the app, and the route service implementation can do whatever it wants.
