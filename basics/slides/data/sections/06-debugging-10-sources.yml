  * `cf logs` App logs
  * `cf events` App events
  * `cf ssh` SSH access to the app container

notes: |

  * Loggregator aggregates logs from all instances and relevant components.  If you suspected a routing problem in your existing org, how would you get the logs?  What if you have 100 instances running?
  * Events shows things like start, stop, crash, etc.
  * If you need to see things inside the container, you can SSH inside.
